## üìä Privacy Score Calculation

### How Privacy Score is Calculated

Your privacy score is calculated based on multiple factors:

```typescript
interface PrivacyFactors {
  enhancedPrivacy: boolean;    // +25 points
  torNetwork: boolean;         // +15 points
  randomDelays: boolean;       // +20 points
  splitTransactions: boolean;  // +15 points
  mixingRounds: number;         // +25 points (max 5 rounds)
  timingRandomization: number;  // +20 points
  addressRotation: boolean;     // +10 points
}
```

### Privacy Score Levels

- **90-100**: Maximum Privacy
- **70-89**: High Privacy
